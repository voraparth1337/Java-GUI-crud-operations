# Java-GUI-crud-operations
## BASIC CRUD  
This is a java gui application that connects with a mySql database and performs CRUD operations. Swings are used to generate the required GUI. DBEngine class is a helper class which establishes connection with database. I have also included mysql connector along with the code, just include that in your libraries and change connection parameters in DBEngine file.  GL HF : )
